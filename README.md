## Making model changes
This repo uses Alembic to sync model changes with database migration files

1. Make your model change
2. `alembic revision --autogenerate "<Descriptive commit message>"`
3. Inspect the migration file generated. Autogenerated files are not infallible -- make sure the SQL commands are accurate and executed in the correct order!
4. If everything looks good: `alembic upgrade head`
5. To downgrade: `alembic downgrade`

See [Alembic Docs](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html) for advanced usage.
